# Third Meeting
## 3rd March 2025 - Carnelley Dâ€™Arcy Thompson Museum 12:00
### Chair: Louis
### Secretary: Beth

### Agenda

1. Welcome - Louis welcomed everyone to the meeting.
2. Minutes of previous meeting - everyone to add their sequences to the README file. Templates for the meetings added to the repository to be filled in for each meeting.
3. Progress check - all members have added their sequences to the README file except Athina (doing this asap). Most members of the group have also started to look at Python and prepare for using it this week/next week.
4. Discuss tasks for the coming week - download sequences (FASTA) and upload these to the sequences section on GitHub. Redirect FASTA links on the README to go to the FASTA sequences in the folder instead of NCBI website. Align sequences in Jalview and run restrict on sequences.
6. Any other business - helpful script for sorting restricted sequences and aligning them in the 'resources' folder.
