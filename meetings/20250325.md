### Agenda

1. Welcome - Louis welcomed everyone to the meeting.
2. Minutes of previous meeting - working on introduction and methods sections of the report, using PrimerBLAST to assess primers.
3. Progress check - Mathew gave a presentation on using eDNA to monitor Iberian freshwater fish population composition. Dr. Martin also explained to the group how to structure our methods section/how much information to include in this (only the absolutely necessary info for someone else who is knowledgable to replicate our methods, include versions of packages we used). We can find package details on Putty using 'conda list' command. We also went over how to use PrimerBLAST to check primer specificity.
4. Discuss tasks for the coming week - continue to work on writing up our reports (with focus on the method section). Assess primers using PrimerBLAST.
5. Any other business.
