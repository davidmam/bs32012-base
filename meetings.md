## Roles

### Presenter
The presenter will give a short presentation. In this module this should be about 15 minutes. It should introduce the background to the project for an expert who has not been there, describe the current state of the project, suggest the next steps and invite discussion.

* Content:
  * Gives the aim of the presentation
  * The presentation is of an appropriate depth and accuracy
* Presentation
  * Provides a concise handout of the presentation (this can be submitted electronically to the chair beforehand)
  * The presentation is appropriately structured and the structure is introduced at the start.
  * Slides should be well structured and clear, with few, if any, grammar/spelling mistakes
  * Speak clearly and intelligbly using appropriate scientific language.
  * Uses appropriate body posture and makes eye contact with the audience
  * the content of the slides and the verbal message fit well with each other.
* Discussion
  * Interacts with well with the audience
  * allows others to finish speaking
  * supports own opinions clearly

### Chair
The chair is responsible for setting the agenda for the meeting and conducting it.
* Agenda
  * Type of meeting, date, time, place and attendees are listed.
  * Agenda distributed on time
  * Agenda contains the appropriate discussion points.
* Chairing the meeting
  * Follows the agenda in leading the meeting
  * Ensures the meeting stays on track
  * Summarises key points during the discussion
  * Gives every one a chance to speak and allows participants to share their views
  * Encourages everyone to listen to each other
  * Ensures that the necessary decisions are made and agreements noted in the minutes.

> #### Agenda and chairing

> Agendas should follow broadly the pattern:
>
> 1.	Welcome
> 2.	Minutes of last meeting. This is where you go back over the  last meeting and pick up all matters arising (actions) that won’t be taken later in the agenda. 
> 3.	Progress so far – presentation
> 4.	Next steps – discussion on how to proceed from there. This is where you need to ensure everyone gets a chance to speak (you can tell those who frequently but in to shut up for a bit and invite the quieter folk to put their ideas forward, and you are also in charge of ensuring that it stays on topic.) , and that you provide a periodic summary. e.g. someone explains at length about something – you summarise that in one or two sentences and check that is what they mean. ‘So what you are saying is ....’. Ensure that the group agree with any conclusions decisions. ‘Are we then agreed that we should do X and person A should do this part, person Y that part?’
> 5.	Any other business – e.g. any specific questions/issues that need to be discussed relating to the project, or highlighting any further explanation/training that needs to be done. 
> 6.	Close the meeting. It is a good practice with a group this size to go round each person in turn and ask if they have anything further to bring to the meeting. That ensures everyone gets their say.

> Then we will do any further training/in depth explanations informally afterwards.
